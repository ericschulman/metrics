# Solutions and code for Econometrics

Solutions for textbook exercises, notes, and code some of which are from weekly TA sessions for first year Ph.D. econometrics at the University of Texas at Austin. The exercises solved and corresponding textbooks are listed by week.

## Datasets

The `data` folder contains miscellaneous data sets from various econometrics textbooks.
* `Card1995.dta` data on [Card 1995's paper](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/geo_var_schooling.pdf) using geographic variation as an instrument for college attendance.
* `cps09mar.dta` From the March 2009 CPS survey. Individuals with non-allocated variables who were full-
time employed.
* `murder_oldstata.dta` This is data on the murder rate which correpsonds to [Wooldridge Problem 10.10](https://rdrr.io/cran/wooldridge/man/murder.html)
* `Nerlove1963.dta` data from [Nerlove's analysis of production functions](https://hhstokes.people.uic.edu/ftp/e535/Nerlove_1955.pdf) and returns to scale.
* `wagepan.dta` data from [Vella and Verbeek 1998](https://www.jstor.org/stable/223257) on wages.
* `MROZ.DTA` data on wages and marriage from [Mroz 1987](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911029).
* `bwght.dta` data on birth weight and cigarettes.

## Notebooks

* Notes on pre-trend plots in Python for differences and differences with average treatment effect on the treated interpretation of differences in differences (Work in progress).
* Notes on the within transformation in Python to estimate fixed effects regression. Code included to perform the transformation. For a more complete fixed effects package see [this repo](https://bashtage.github.io/linearmodels/panel/panel/linearmodels.panel.model.PanelOLS.html).
